                "content": "Hi All, \\n\\nI just completed my DP adventure which I started in last June and I would like to share my findings in this post. \\nThere are total 241 dp tagged problems in LeetCode as of Today, and 26 of them are locked so I only solved the public ones.\\n\\n* First of all, I participated the monthly challange April & May, so this really helped me to build a habbit of daily problem solving\\n* Then I started to solve DP problems and kept updating my monthly problem list here. \\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/665187/everyday-dp-challenge-list\\n* The average pace was about 1 problem per day.\\n* I read these great articles to learn the general dynamic programming knowledge & patterns\\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/Dynamic-Programming-Patterns\\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/662866/DP-for-Beginners-Problems-or-Patterns-or-Sample-Solutions \\n\\nThe followings are my categorization of the all 215 DP problems.
